# What caught eight wrong claims in one day

**2026-09-08. Chief and D-CRO.** The programme pivoted to Gemma 3 and spent a day auditing its own
instruments. Eight claims were made and refuted between two seats. None reached a conclusion, and
none was caught by review, argument or seniority. Every one was caught by a measurement whose answer
was known in advance.

This record is the technique rather than the findings, because the technique is what transfers. The
findings are about Gemma 3 4B; this is about how a small team stops itself believing things.

## The eight

| # | the claim | who | what killed it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Gemma does not copy literal strings" | Chief | per-call path fidelity: **0.806** against Qwen's **0.805** |
| 2 | "Our false empty listing caused the loop" | Chief | one episode re-run on the fixed simulator: it still fails, differently |
| 3 | "The environment has no discoverable root" | Chief, D-CRO | `search_files` returns the true path from any prompt word, on 165 of 180 tasks |
| 4 | "`n_valid_positions = 111` bounds the fitted position" | Chief | the upstream source: it is a count; `SKIP_FIRST_N_POSITIONS = 16` |
| 5 | "Stereotyped JSON commits earlier in depth, being predictable" | Chief | a control of the same syntactic kind: it commits **later**, 30 against 24 |
| 6 | "Wrong paths commit earlier than right ones" | D-CRO | dedup: 29 of 34 were one fixed point counted 29 times; the effect vanished |
| 7 | "The correct alternative appears at 2 of 24 forks" | D-CRO | the identity check at a boundary: 100% grouped by turn, 4% keyed flat |
| 8 | "0 of 540 tasks are reachable by search" | D-CRO | a single-task check, run because the zero was too clean |

Four of the eight were the Chief's, three the D-CRO's, one shared. That distribution is not the
point. **The shape is the point, and it is the same eight times.**

## The shape

Each half does work.

**More persuasive than its parts.** Claim 6 was a clean 24-against-30 split on exactly the layer pair
the map was built to examine. Claim 8 was 0 of 540, a perfect result. Claim 1 was 165 of 180 tasks
carrying a literal path, a real number that licensed a false one. An aggregate hides its own
composition, and the larger it is the more it hides.

**Wrong in the direction of the hypothesis.** Not one of the eight was a random error. Every one made
the thing its author already believed look true. Claim 8 is the sharpest: a bare `except Exception:
continue` around a call to a method that does not exist scored every task unreachable, and the author
believed the root was unreachable. **A bug that disagrees with you is found in minutes. A bug that
agrees with you is published.**

**Caught by a known answer.** This is the operative half, because the first two describe the disease
and this one is the treatment.

## The three mechanisms, in order of how much they caught

### 1. A check whose answer you already know, run at a boundary

Claim 7 was caught because the final layer's readout *is* the model's own distribution, so its top-1
*must* be the emitted token. Grouped correctly it was 100% of 1,173 emissions; keyed the wrong way it
was 4%. Nothing else in the chain would have revealed that two coordinate systems had been conflated,
because every other number was plausible.

The check was, separately and correctly, judged near-worthless as validation: it proves the sampler is
greedy and proves nothing about the lens. **Both are true, and the tension is the lesson.** A check
that cannot fail teaches nothing about the thing it points at, and is the only thing that catches a
join, an index convention or an off-by-one. Keep it, label it honestly as what it asserts, and never
let its passing stand in for validation it does not perform.

Claim 8 was caught the same way, informally: 0 of 540 is a value the author knew could not be right.

### 2. A control of the same kind as the thing measured

Claim 5 died against a control built from argument-start tokens specifically, rather than from a
pooled background of prose and JSON together. Against the pooled background the effect read as
unremarkable at 0.258; against its own syntactic kind it was 0.016. **The control did not dissolve
the finding, it sharpened it by a factor of sixteen** — which is the argument for building the right
control rather than the available one, in both directions.

The generalisation: before comparing two spans, check that neither is a compound of populations that
behave oppositely. A "call span" turned out to be exactly that — skeleton tokens committing at layer
24 and argument tokens at layer 30 — so any single figure over it averaged away the effect. This
forced a pre-registered comparison to be restated before it was ever computed.

### 3. Deduplication before any count is called a sample size

Claim 6 died because 29 of 34 observations were one decision repeated. **A decision a model repeats
is one observation, not many.** Twenty-three identical calls are twenty-three copies of one
commitment, and pooling them produced a clean, false result on the layer pair under study.

This is now a rule: no count over positions is quoted as a sample size without deduplicating
byte-identical repeated decisions within an episode. It is aimed at the most persuasive artefact in
the corpus, because that is the one that needs it.

## Two practices that made the catching possible

**Keep the refuted version beside the corrected one.** Both authors kept their wrong tables in the
record rather than deleting them, so the next reader meets the persuasive version already refuted
instead of rediscovering it as a result. A record that merely omits a refuted claim leaves the trap
armed.

**Run the experiment that threatens your own account.** Claim 2 was killed by a test the Chief asked
the D-CRO to run *because* it risked the Chief's explanation. It took 66 seconds and it came back
against him. The cost of the test was negligible; the cost of stage two proceeding on a wrong causal
story would not have been.

## What transfers, stated without reference to this code

1. Before believing an aggregate, deduplicate it and recompute. If the effect is carried by repeats
   of one event, there is no effect.
2. Build the control from the same class as the thing measured, not from everything else.
3. Keep at least one check whose answer is known in advance, and run it at a boundary. Label it as an
   assertion about bookkeeping, never as validation of the instrument.
4. Treat a clean number as a reason for suspicion proportional to how much you wanted it.
5. A bare `except: continue` around a measurement is a machine for producing agreeable falsehoods.
6. When a claim is refuted, strike it where it was made. A correction two hundred lines below a bold
   sentence leaves the bold sentence doing the work.
7. Run the cheap experiment that could refute you, first.

**None of the eight was caught by being careful.** All eight authors were being careful. They were
caught by mechanisms that do not depend on care, which is the only kind worth building.
